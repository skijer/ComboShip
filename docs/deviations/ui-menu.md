# ComboShip deviations — Menu & UI

Preserved deviations — keep across upstream merges. See [../UPSTREAM_MERGES.md](../UPSTREAM_MERGES.md) for the merge mechanism.

## UIWidgets empty-combobox UB + combo-rendered MM rando menu (2026-06-09)

**`mm/2s2h/BenGui/UIWidgets.hpp` (and `soh/soh/SohGui/UIWidgets.hpp`) — fix to a vendored upstream
bug:** every `UIWidgets::Combobox` template overload declared `const char* longest;` **uninitialized**,
then assigned it only inside the loop that scans the options for the widest entry. If the options
container is empty, `longest` stays garbage and the immediately-following
`CalcComboWidth(longest, ...)` → `ImGui::CalcTextSize` dereferences it → crash. Changed to
`const char* longest = "";` in all overloads, with a `// ComboShip:` comment explaining why. This is a
genuine upstream bug; OOT's `std::vector<std::string>` overload happened to already have the
initializer, but its three other overloads (map / `vector<const char*>` / fixed array) did not — those
were fixed too. WHY it surfaced: MM's rando "Seed" combobox reads `Rando::Spoiler::spoilerOptions`,
which is empty when the combo layer renders MM's always-available rando menu while MM is backgrounded.

**`mm/2s2h/BenPort.cpp` (`Combo_EnsureBenMenu()`):** belt-and-suspenders for the same symptom —
`spoilerOptions` is populated by `Rando::Init()` → `RefreshOptions()` at boot, but in the
combo/backgrounded render path that vector can be empty. `Combo_EnsureBenMenu()` (called by every MM
menu export — ExportMenu / InvokeCallback / EvalDisabled / DrawCustom) now calls
`Rando::Spoiler::RefreshOptions()` when `spoilerOptions.empty()`, so the menu has real options to draw.
`RefreshOptions` is idempotent (clears + repopulates) and only runs when empty. No new include needed
(`2s2h/Rando/Spoiler/Spoiler.h` was already included).

**Note:** other MM rando tabs (Logic / Items / etc.) may have their own backgrounded-live-state crashes;
out of scope here, handled as they surface.

## Menu code extraction to combo-owned headers (2026-06-10)

The ComboShip-written menu glue that lived inside the vendored trees was consolidated into
combo-owned, header-only units under `combo/menu/` (already on both games' include paths, so no
game CMake changes). The headers compile INTO each game DLL — only the SOURCE ownership moved —
so future upstream pulls conflict at most on small per-game glue blocks, never on the algorithms:

- **`combo/menu/ComboMenuExport.h`** — the two-pass count/reserve/fill CwMenu serializer that was
  copy-pasted in `soh/soh/SohGui/SohMenu.cpp` and `mm/2s2h/BenGui/BenMenu.cpp` (~260 lines each).
  Each game now keeps only its `WidgetTypeToCwKind` mapping + a Policy struct
  (`SohExportPolicy` / `BenExportPolicy`) + a one-line delegate. Pointer-stability invariant
  (reserve == fill) is now assert-checked and unit-tested
  (`libultraship/tests/combo_menu_export_tests.cpp`, mock-based, runs in `lus_tests`).
- **`combo/menu/ComboMenuDrawContent.h`** — the shared `Menu::DrawContent` ImGui body (~230 lines
  each) that mirrored the upstream `DrawElement` layout inside comboui's window. Each game keeps a
  Hooks shim (`SohDrawHooks` / `BenDrawHooks`) + a ~30-line wrapper. Upstream `DrawElement` is
  untouched. WHY a TU-glue header (`#error` guard, no own ImGui include): it must resolve each
  game's OWN UIWidgets/draw functions and per-module compile context.
- **`combo/menu/ComboMenuSharedContext.h`** — `ComboMenuContext::UseSharedImGuiContext()`, replacing
  2 static + 3 inline duplicated copies in `soh/soh/OTRGlobals.cpp` / `mm/2s2h/BenPort.cpp`.

Intentional micro-deviations from the pre-extraction bodies (do not "fix" back): empty tooltips are
no longer copied into owned-string storage (output still `""`); MM's redundant
`GetVectorIndexOf(sidebarOrder, …)` fallback clause was dropped (subsumed by the `std::find` over
`visibleSidebars`); OOT's widget label width now uses the clamped column count like MM (visible
only below 800px window width).

Net effect: vendored menu diff vs upstream shrank from ~1,630 to ~907 added lines across soh/ + mm/.

## hook_handlers.h re-added (combo-owned) (2026-06-11)

**`soh/soh/Enhancements/randomizer/hook_handlers.h`** — upstream has NO such header at our vendor
tip (functions in hook_handlers.cpp are static/self-registered). ComboShip re-added it to expose
`OOT_LookupForeign` (the per-slot foreign-item map lookup) to `Messages/MerchantMessages.cpp` and
the check tracker for cross-game item display names. The file contains only `#ifdef COMBO_BUILD`
declarations and MUST be preserved on future upstream merges — an upstream pull that "removes the
deleted file" silently breaks the foreign shop/tracker name builds.

## Dual-game title screen logos (2026-06-12)

**`soh/src/overlays/actors/ovl_En_Mag/z_en_mag.c`:** the OOT title screen now shows BOTH games'
logos — OOT's shrunk and shifted left, MM's title logo (mask + Zelda logo + subtitle, ROM-extracted
textures resolved against MM's ResourceManager via the G_COMBO_RM_PUSH/POP interpreter bracket) on
the right. Both games' flame-effect mask grids (OOT 3x3 `gTitleEffectMask*`, MM 2x3
`gTitleScreenDisplayEffectMask*` + per-cell `gTitleScreenFlame0-3`) draw behind their logos, scaled
and repositioned with them; MM's oscillating effect colors are replicated in the combo header
(OOT's EnMag doesn't carry MM state). The early-out therefore sits BEFORE the original effect-grid
combiner setup, so the skipped vendored region spans from `gDPSetCycleType` through the MQ
subtitle. All draw code
is combo-owned (`combo/title/ComboTitleLogos.h`, included after the LOGO_* macros so it can reuse
them and the EnMag_Draw* helpers). The vendored logo block in `EnMag_DrawInner` is left BYTE-INTACT
for upstream merges; a `#ifdef COMBO_BUILD`-guarded early-out (`if (ComboTitle_DrawLogos(...))
goto ...;` + a guarded label after the block) skips it at runtime, so non-combo builds compile the
file unchanged. On future merges, keep the include + the goto wrapper and re-check
that the duplicated OOT-logo draw sequence in ComboTitleLogos.h still matches upstream's (combiner
setup, texture names, MQ subtitle branch).

**`soh/CMakeLists.txt`:** added `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/combo/title` to the include dirs (next to the
existing `combo/menu` entry).

## File-select seed-hash icons for combo seeds (issue #32, 2026-06-23)

**Why:** stock SoH draws five item icons on the file-select as a visual seed hash so players can
match seeds/spoiler logs. The combo build showed five Deku Nuts (or an identical set every seed):
the combo generator owns generation and never runs OOT's `Playthrough_Init`, which is where vanilla
calls `GenerateHash()` to fill `Rando::Context::hashIconIndexes` — so the array stayed all-zero.
Scope is OOT only: combo boots into OOT's file-select and enters MM via transition, so MM's
file-select is never shown (MM's `finalSeed = 0` gap in `MM_InitRandoSaveFile` is a known follow-up).

**Change (vendored `soh`, minimal):** new export `SOH_SetComboSeedHash(uint32_t)` in
`OTRGlobals.cpp` (just after `SOH_ApplyRandoPlacements`) calls `ctx->SetHash(...)` + `GenerateHash()`
— mirrors stock `playthrough.cpp:64-73`. Added `#include ".../3drando/spoiler_log.hpp"` for the
declaration. Persistence/render are stock-wired (`SaveManager` copies into `fileMetaInfo.seedHash`;
`z_file_choose.c` renders it).

**Change (combo-owned, `ComboShip.cpp`):** `RunComboFill` computes a settings-aware display hash
`ComboHash(inputSeed + sohDump + mmDump)` and passes it to the new export *after*
`SOH_ApplyRandoPlacements` (which `ItemReset`s). Folding both static dumps in makes the icons
identify seed **and** settings: each dump is built from its game's live CVars and carries only the
settings-scoped pool, so OOT *and* MM shuffle/starting-item settings both vary the icons. Accepted
limitation (symmetric): a logic-only setting that doesn't change the shuffled pool (e.g. tricks)
won't change the dump, so won't change the icons.

**On future merges:** if upstream restructures `GenerateHash`/`SetHash` or the file-select hash
render, re-point the new export; the combo-side hash derivation is independent.

## File-select quest menu locked to Randomizer (2026-06-27)

**Why:** the combo build drives a randomizer through OOT's normal save flow; showing the Normal /
Master Quest / Boss Rush quest options on file-select is confusing since they're never the intent.

**Change (vendored `soh`, one COMBO_BUILD-guarded block):** in
`soh/src/overlays/gamestates/ovl_file_choose/z_file_choose.c`, the `MIN_QUEST`/`MAX_QUEST` macros
(which seed `questType` at init and bound the L/R carousel wrap) are redefined to `QUEST_RANDOMIZER`
under `COMBO_BUILD`. The carousel therefore starts on Randomizer and every L/R wrap lands back on it,
so the other quests are unreachable — no draw/branch code was deleted (the non-combo build is
byte-intact via the `#else`).

**On future merges:** if upstream changes the quest enum or the carousel wrap logic, re-check that
the locked `MIN_QUEST == MAX_QUEST == QUEST_RANDOMIZER` still resolves to Randomizer on every L/R
path (incl. the Master-Quest-absent skip loop).

## Live-apply settings changed from the combo menu (2026-06-28)

**Why:** the games' native UIWidgets call `ShipInit::Init(cvar)` after a widget change to re-run the
enhancement registered for that CVar; comboui only set the CVar, so combo-menu changes didn't apply
until the next `ShipInit::InitAll` (game boot / new save). New exports `SOH_MenuApplyCVarChange` /
`MM_MenuApplyCVarChange` (OTRGlobals.cpp / BenPort.cpp) run `ShipInit::Init(cvar)`; the comboui menu
model + `ComboWidgetRender` call them after each change. Fixes #27. **On future merges:** if the
native UIWidgets stop using `ShipInit::Init`-on-change, revisit.

## Shared-settings consolidation + dev-tool window fixes (issue #22, 2026-06-28)

**Why:** three related issues in the shared menu/window subsystem. (a) #22 — MM ignored the Shared
tab's Graphics/Audio/Controls and the per-game tabs redundantly exposed them. (b) Opening MM's "Save
Editor" showed OOT's: the shared `Gui::AddGuiWindow` keys by display name and rejects duplicates, so
MM's identically-named dev windows were dropped (OOT boots first). (c) Dev-tool windows only offered a
"popout" button, never rendering inline.

**Vendored (additive, `COMBO_BUILD`-guarded):**
- `mm/2s2h/BenGui/BenGui.cpp` — the 9 MM dev/debug windows whose names collide with OOT's (Save Editor,
  Actor/Collision/Message Viewer, Audio Editor, Mod Menu, Hook Debugger, Input Viewer (+Settings)) now
  register with `COMBO_MM_TRACKER_SUFFIX` (`"##MM"`), same mechanism as the trackers — map-key/ID only,
  visible title unchanged, empty in standalone. (Cosmetic Editor / Time Splits Window / DL Viewer differ
  from OOT's strings already, so they don't collide.)
- `mm/2s2h/BenGui/BenMenu.cpp` — matching `WindowName(...)` popout refs carry the same suffix
  (`COMBO_MM_WINDOW_SUFFIX`). New `#ifdef COMBO_BUILD` inline `WIDGET_CUSTOM` entries render each dev
  window's `DrawElement()` inline (skipped when popped out, so no double-draw); live-world viewers
  (Actor/Collision/Message/DL/Event Log) gate on `Combo_MmIsForeground()` so they don't read MM's
  dormant/swapped play state when the MM tab is opened while OOT is foreground.
- `soh/soh/SohGui/SohMenuDevTools.cpp` + `OTRGlobals.cpp` — the same inline `WIDGET_CUSTOM` treatment for
  OOT's dev tools, gating live viewers on `Combo_OotIsForeground()`. Both `Combo_*IsForeground` helpers
  resolve comboui's `ComboUI_GetForegroundGame` once.
- `mm/2s2h/BenPort.cpp` — exports `MM_ApplyAudioVolume(seqPlayer, vol)` (→ `AudioSeq_SetPortVolumeScale`,
  the apply path MM uses instead of ShipInit) and `MM_ReloadControls()` (reloads MM's ControlDeck ports
  from the shared `gSettings.Controllers.*` CVars); `Combo_MmIsForeground()` queries comboui's
  foreground game. All inside the existing `COMBO_BUILD` export block.

**Combo-owned:**
- `combo/gui/ComboAudioBridge.{h,cpp}` — one-way mirror of OOT's canonical `gSettings.Volume.*` (int
  0-100) into MM's `gSettings.Audio.*` (float 0-1). `MirrorIfVolumeCVar` fires from the
  `ComboWidgetRender` apply-step; `SyncAllToMM` runs on MM entry. Graphics needs no bridge (one shared
  window) and Controls' data is already shared CVars.
- `combo/gui/ComboForeground.h` + `ComboTrackerVisibility.cpp` — cache the foreground game from the
  existing `ComboUI_OnForegroundGame` callback; expose `ComboUI::GetForegroundGame()` (C++) and
  `ComboUI_GetForegroundGame()` (C ABI, for MM's gating). On MM entry the callback also runs
  `ComboAudio::SyncAllToMM()` + `MM_ReloadControls` so changes made while MM was dormant take effect.
- `combo/gui/ComboMenu.cpp` — the per-game tab sidebar filter now also hides MM's
  Graphics/Audio/Controls/General (they live only in Shared, on shared CVars). **On future merges:** if
  MM's audio CVar names/scale change, update `kMap` in `ComboAudioBridge.cpp` (note: the OOT `Volume.*`
  defaults — Master 40, rest 100 — are duplicated in `kMap`'s `defaultPct` and must match
  SohMenuSettings.cpp, else an untouched slider reads as 0 and silences MM).

## Combo-side Advanced Resolution editor (issue #26 #3, 2026-06-29)

**Why:** SoH's Advanced Resolution editor (`soh/soh/SohGui/ResolutionEditor.cpp`) is built from
machinery the flat C-ABI menu snapshot can't carry — dynamic `WIDGET_TEXT` names set per-frame by a
`PreFunc`, an aspect-ratio combobox bound to a C++ static via `ValuePointer` (no CVar), two
`WIDGET_CUSTOM` draw lambdas, and a per-page `UpdateResolutionVars` MenuUpdate func. In the overlay
those widgets render broken (empty `{} x {}` readouts, an empty-CVar combobox, placeholder customs,
dead aspect/enable controls). User chose a combo-side reimplementation (works regardless of which
game is foreground) over a game-side custom-draw dependency.

**Combo-owned (no vendored edits):**
- `combo/gui/ComboResolutionEditor.{h,cpp}` — `TryRenderResolutionWidget(w)`, called at the top of
  `ComboWidgetRender::RenderWidget`. Intercepts the resolution widgets **by name/cvar** and renders
  combo controls over the effective `gSettings.AdvancedResolution.*` CVars (libultraship's shared
  `Fast3dGui::ApplyResolutionChanges` reads them live each frame). Stateless per-frame: the CVars are
  the source of truth. Live dims read from `Fast::Interpreter` via `Fast3dWindow::GetInterpreterWeak`.
  Owns the Enable checkbox + calls `SaveConsoleVariablesNextFrame` after writes so changes persist.
  Scope = core controls; niche extras (horizontal-res-field alt, NeverExceedBounds/ExceedBoundsBy,
  IgnoreAspectCorrection) intentionally omitted.

**On future merges (coupling — re-verify):** this **shadows specific SoH widget names** —
`"Aspect Ratio"` (empty-cvar combo), `"AspectRatioCustom"`, `"MoreResolutionSettings"`, the
`"Viewport dimensions"`/`"Internal resolution"` readout prefixes, the `"...is overriding these
settings"` / `"Click to disable N64 mode"` advisories — and **transcribes SoH's preset tables**
(aspect labels + X/Y, pixel-count labels + values, clamps). If SoH renames those widgets or changes
the tables, re-sync `ComboResolutionEditor.cpp` (else the widgets silently fall back to the broken
generic render). CVar prefix `gSettings.AdvancedResolution` comes from `CMake/lus-cvars.cmake`.

## Inline controller bindings on Shared → Controls (issue #26 #1, 2026-06-29)

**Why:** SoH's Controls page is popout-only (no inline bindings widget), so the combo overlay showed
just a "Popout Bindings Window" button — the user had to detach a floating window to rebind.

**Vendored (additive, `COMBO_BUILD`-guarded):**
- `soh/soh/SohGui/SohMenuSettings.cpp` — a new "Controller Bindings Inline" `WIDGET_CUSTOM` in the
  Controls section draws the "Configure Controller" (`SohInputEditorWindow`) inline, reusing the
  issue #22 inline-window mechanism (get the registered `GuiWindow`; skip when `IsVisible()`/popped
  out to avoid double-draw; `Update()` then `DrawElement()`). No foreground gate — the input editor
  only touches the shared `ControlDeck`, not OOT play state.

One inline editor (OOT's) covers both games: controls are shared `gSettings.Controllers.*` CVars and
`MM_ReloadControls` reloads MM from them, and MM's Controls sidebar is hidden in the overlay (above),
so no MM-side change is needed. **On future merges:** if SoH renames the "Configure Controller"
window, update the name string here.

## Link's Voice Pitch Multiplier CVar collision (2026-08-04)

**Why:** SoH stores its pitch slider as a float **leaf** `gAudioEditor.LinkVoiceFreqMultiplier`
while 2Ship stores **children** of that exact path (`.Enable`/`.Scale`). Upstream never meet; in the
shared ComboShip CVar table + single config both coexist, and `Config::Save`'s `unflatten()` throws
(json can't make one key both scalar and object) — an uncaught crash that also truncated the config
file (the `ofstream` opened before `unflatten`).

**Vendored (`COMBO_BUILD`-guarded):**
- `soh/soh/cvar_prefixes.h` — `CVAR_LINK_VOICE_FREQ_MULTIPLIER` resolves to the `.Scale` child in
  combo builds (upstream leaf otherwise); used at the 3 SoH sites (widget, reset button, z_actor.c
  read). Side effect: both games share one pitch value; MM still gates behind `.Enable`.
- `soh/soh/OTRGlobals.cpp` (`Combo_FinishInit`, after `RunVersionUpdates()`) — one-shot migration of
  the old leaf to `.Scale` (covers old combo configs, the legacy `gLinkVoiceFreqMultiplier` updater
  target, and launcher-imported standalone SoH configs, which all still produce the leaf). Gated on
  table presence (not float type — a legacy int leaf must still be cleared) and followed by
  `CVarSave()` so a mid-session `ConsoleVariable::Load` can't resurrect the leaf from disk.
- `libultraship/src/ship/config/Config.{h,cpp}` — all four `unflatten()` sites (`Save`, `Nested`,
  `SetBlock`, `EraseBlock`) route through a `TryUnflatten` helper that logs instead of throwing
  (the exception would unwind across the game-DLL boundary); `Save()` unflattens **before**
  opening/truncating the file; `Nested()` falls back to the last-good nested state on failure.

**On future merges:** if upstream SoH renames the CVar or grows its own `.Enable`, drop the macro
seam and re-check the migration. Audited 2026-08-04: this was the only cross-game leaf-vs-subtree
CVar pair (other candidates were Color-CVar bases, never stored as leaves).

Follow-up (same day): the checkbox still didn't enable the slider — MM's `disabledMap` per-frame
refresh lives only in `Menu::DrawElement`, which never runs under comboui, so popout windows
(Audio Editor, Mod Menu) that draw via `MenuDrawItem` read a frozen disable flag.
`mm/2s2h/BenGui/Menu.cpp` (`Menu::MenuDrawItem`, `COMBO_BUILD`-guarded) now refreshes the map once
per ImGui frame. SoH needs no parity fix: its popout-drawn widgets have no disable-map preFuncs.

## Config::SetBlock drops writes when intermediate keys are missing (2026-08-10)

**Why:** `SetBlock`'s dot-walk only descended into keys that already existed — a missing
intermediate (e.g. `CVars.gRando` on a config that never saved a gRando key) made the whole write a
silent no-op. Surfaced as `MM_RestoreRandoSettings` failing to restore an empty
`gRando.StartingItems: []` kit: `SetStartingItemsInConfig` never landed, exact-seed repro fell back
to the default kit. (Related pre-existing quirk, handled by callers: nlohmann `flatten()` turns an
empty array into null; `GetStartingItemsFromConfig` treats null as empty.)

**Vendored:** `libultraship/src/ship/config/Config.cpp` (`SetBlock`) — create missing intermediate
objects and descend; a non-object in the path keeps the old silent no-op (`ComboShip:` comment at
site).

## Mod ordering never survived a restart (2026-08-24)

**Why:** two independent defects, both combo-only.

(a) Both mod menus stored the user's mod order in the SAME CVar, `gSettings.EnabledMods` — soh via
`CVAR_SETTING("EnabledMods")`, MM via a hardcoded literal, and `CVAR_PREFIX_SETTING` is `gSettings`
in both games. In combo MM reuses OOT's Context and skips `InitConsoleVariables()`, so
ConsoleVariables is shared. `UpdateModFiles(init=true)` erases every listed name it can't find in
*its own* mods dir and rewrites the key; OOT scans `./mods/soh`, MM scans `./mods/2ship`, so each
wiped the other's names. OOT boots first and MM writes last, so after every launch the key held only
MM's mods (or `""`, since `./mods/2ship` is auto-created even when empty) and the order was rebuilt
path-sorted on the next boot. Same shared key also crashed OOT's Mod Menu: Edit -> Cancel re-reads
the CVar without pruning (`init == false`), then `DrawMods` hit `filePaths.at()` on an MM name.

(b) MM's `BenModalWindow` registered as `"Modal Window"`, which OOT already owns, so
`Gui::AddGuiWindow` rejected it and it was never drawn. MM's Mod Menu "Clear List" and "Apply &
Close" queue into a `BenModals` global vector that only that window drains — both buttons did nothing
at all, so an MM order could never be saved.

**Vendored (additive, `COMBO_BUILD`-guarded unless noted):**
- `mm/2s2h/Enhancements/ModMenu/ModMenu.cpp` — MM's key becomes `gSettings.EnabledModsMM`. A SIBLING
  leaf, never a child: `gSettings.EnabledMods.MM` would put a leaf and a subtree at one path, the
  failure behind `CVAR_LINK_VOICE_FREQ_MULTIPLIER`. Since `Config::TryUnflatten` now logs instead of
  throwing, that would silently drop every config write rather than crash.
- `mm/2s2h/BenGui/BenGui.cpp` — `"Modal Window" COMBO_MM_TRACKER_SUFFIX`. Nothing resolves MM's modal
  by name (MM uses the `BenGui::mModalWindow` static), and the visibility CVars already differed
  (`gWindows.ModalWindow` vs OOT's `gOpenWindows.ModalWindow`).
- `mm/2s2h/BenGui/Menu.cpp` — seed `menuThemeIndex` in the ctor (mirroring
  `soh/soh/SohGui/Menu.cpp`) **and** clamp it in `GetMenuThemeColor()`. Required: registering the
  modal makes it draw every frame from the Gui loop, and `THEME_COLOR` resolves to a member that only
  `UpdateElement()` sets — which under comboui runs only once MM's tab is drawn — so `ColorValues.at()`
  would throw out of 2ship.dll across the DLL boundary. The ctor seed alone is not enough:
  `MM_MenuDrawCustom` calls `Update()`, which re-reads the CVar unclamped, so the clamp belongs at the
  `GetMenuThemeColor()` funnel where every `THEME_COLOR` read passes. Also fixes a live crash for
  anyone with `gWindows.InputViewerSettings=1` (`InputViewerSettingsWindow::DrawElement` uses
  `THEME_COLOR`; `InputViewer::DrawElement` does not).
- `mm/2s2h/BenGui/BenModals.cpp` — `ImGuiPopupFlags_NoOpenOverExistingPopup` plus a `PushID("MM")`
  scope. Neither modal window calls `Begin()`, so both open at popup level 0 and hash their popup ids
  against the same window. Both games use the exact titles "Clear List" and "Apply & Close", so
  without the `PushID` MM would draw its message and buttons into OOT's popup with colliding button
  ids — one click could run the other game's callback. The flag is the level tie-break: it is
  one-way (OOT's `OpenPopup` stays unflagged), so OOT wins and MM retries next frame.
- `soh/soh/Enhancements/mod_menu.cpp` + `mm/.../ModMenu.cpp` — a plain "Apply" that writes the CVar
  and leaves edit mode without closing. `SetEnabledModsCVarValue` already calls
  `SaveConsoleVariablesNextFrame()`, so no explicit `Save()`; "Apply & Close" needs its own only
  because it closes before the next frame. Upstream's "Apply & Close" is unchanged, and in combo it
  takes both games down.
- Both mod menus, **not** guarded — a `filePaths.find()` skip at the top of `DrawMods`' loop. A
  genuine upstream bug (a file deleted mid-session throws out of the inline-menu draw path, and
  neither `SOH_MenuDrawCustom` nor `MM_MenuDrawCustom` has a try/catch); correct in standalone too,
  and an `#ifdef` around one `continue` would be worse than the line. The doc entry is the only
  record, since the line carries no `ComboShip:` marker — re-check it after upstream merges.

**Residuals, accepted:** OOT's Presets "Settings" block bulk-clears the whole `gSettings` subtree, so
an OOT settings-preset apply clears both mod lists — benign, they rebuild from disk. The
`GetMenuThemeColor()` clamp covers every `THEME_COLOR` read, but a dozen MM sites read
`gSettings.Menu.Theme` directly with `CVarGetInteger` and stay unclamped; soh's `Menu` is unclamped
throughout, unchanged here because OOT's modal was always registered. If a game's mods dir doesn't
exist, `UpdateModFiles` skips its whole body and leaves the list unpruned and unwritten. When a mod
file vanishes mid-session the skipped row leaves the up/down arrows working on raw vector indices, so
a swap with a skipped neighbour changes the list without changing what is drawn (and a shift-range
selection can pick up the invisible name) — cosmetic, in an already-degraded state.

**On future merges:** the theme seeding relies on soh's and MM's `UIWidgets::Colors` enums and
`ColorValues` maps being identical (`soh/soh/SohGui/UIWidgetOptions.hpp` vs
`mm/2s2h/BenGui/UIWidgets.hpp`) because `gSettings.Menu.Theme` is shared. If a merge diverges them,
the shared key becomes unsafe. Also re-check the `Modal Window` suffix and the "Apply" button if
upstream reworks the mod menu.

## Combo-owned overlay timers (issue #173, 2026-08-24)

**Why:** OOT's "Additional Timers" and MM's "Display Overlay" each showed only their own game's play
time, so a combo run never had a number covering the whole run. MM also had a live bug: its play time
is wall clock between flushes (`filePlaytime += now - lastTimeLog`) and `lastTimeLog` was never
advanced when combo swapped away, so hours spent in OOT were folded into MM's save at its next flush.

**Combo-owned:** `combo/gui/ComboTimersWindow.{h,cpp}` — window `Timers##Combo`, CVars `gCombo.Timers.*`,
settings under ComboShip Settings → Timers. The total is `OOT playTimer/2 + pauseTimer/3` (deciseconds)
plus MM's `filePlaytime/100`; both already live in the `.combosav`, and exactly one advances at a time.
Time of day / Navi / conditional draw only while OOT is foreground. `Combo_SetForegroundGame` pauses
and resumes MM's accumulator across every swap. The total tints green once both games are beaten
(`ComboUI_SetComboComplete`, pushed from the existing `combo.completion` flags — no new save key).

**No real-time (RTA) row, deliberately.** MM's `GetUnixTimestamp` (`mm/2s2h/BenPort.cpp`) assigns
`millis.count()` to a `long`, which is 32-bit on Windows, so every MM timestamp is truncated modulo
2^32 — `fileCreatedAt` lands around 8.6e8 where soh's untruncated ms is around 1.79e12. MM's own
timestamps stay self-consistent (differences survive the truncation until it wraps, every ~49.7 days),
so this is invisible inside 2Ship, but it makes MM and OOT timestamps incomparable. A first attempt at
an RTA row took `min(OOT firstInput, MM fileCreatedAt)` and displayed 496307 hours. **Never compare a
soh timestamp with an MM one** without fixing the truncation first.

**Vendored (all `COMBO_BUILD`-guarded):**
- `soh/soh/OTRGlobals.cpp` — `SOH_GetPlaytimeDeciseconds`, `SOH_GetOverlayTimers` (classification
  stays in soh so comboui hardcodes no vanilla enum values).
- `mm/2s2h/BenPort.cpp` — `MM_GetPlaytimeMs`, `MM_ComboPausePlaytime`,
  `MM_ComboResumePlaytime` + a running latch. The advance is implemented locally rather than calling
  `SavingEnhancements_AdvancePlaytime` so `SavingEnhancements.cpp` stays untouched. The
  `lastTimeLog != 0` guard matters because `z_sram_NES.c` zeroes it on a new file — treating 0 as a
  timestamp would add a whole Unix epoch (~57 years).
- `soh/soh/SohGui/SohMenuEnhancements.cpp` and `mm/2s2h/BenGui/BenMenu.cpp` — the native timer menu
  entries are `#ifndef COMBO_BUILD`. A sidebar allow-list is not enough: `ComboMenu::DrawSearchResults`
  walks both games' menu models unfiltered, so a search for "timer" would re-open the native window.

**Do not remove** the `TimeDisplayWindow` registration at `soh/soh/SohGui/SohGui.cpp:203` — its
`InitElement` is what loads the digit and icon textures the combo overlay draws with. Only its draw
is suppressed.

**Residuals:** the pause only flushes into memory — nothing persists MM's save on the way out — so
time played in MM without an owl/auto save is lost when the slot's MM blob is re-read (reset or
owl-save quit, `g_MmSaveInMemorySlot = -1`), and the total steps back to MM's last saved value. Same
as vanilla 2ship.

**Separate bug found while playtesting this, NOT fixed here:** MM's play time reads 0 after an owl
save because `SaveManager_LoadSaveFile` (`mm/2s2h/SaveManager/SaveManager.cpp`) reads only the
`newCycleSave` key and never `owlSave`. ComboShip's resume shortcut (`mm/src/code/title_setup.c`,
`COMBO_BUILD` block) goes through that function instead of vanilla's `Sram_OpenSave`, which picks the
owl page when `isOwlSave` is set and then deletes it on continue (`VB_DELETE_OWL_SAVE`). So an owl
save's whole state — not just play time — is discarded on a combo resume. Note that a new-cycle save
deliberately preserves `owlSave`, so a read-priority fix alone would let a stale owl save shadow a
newer cycle save; the delete-on-continue half is required too.


## Cross-game settings sync (2026-09-08)

**Why:** the two DLLs share one `ConsoleVariables` store, so ~110 settings are already literally one
CVar. The rest are the same player-facing option under two names — `gCheats.InfiniteRupees` vs
`gCheats.InfiniteMoney`, `gEnhancements.Camera.FreeLook.*` vs `gSettings.FreeLook.*`,
`gNotifications.*` vs `gSettings.Notifications.*`, and the shuffle options both randomizers read the
same way. The combo overlay rendered both games' sections side by side, so each of those was two
visible controls for one concept.

**Combo-owned, no game-source change:** `combo/gui/ComboSettingsSync.{h,cpp}` — an 80-row table in 8
categories (`gCombo.Sync.*`, all default on), reconciled from a logic-only `GuiWindow` registered in
`ComboUI_Register`. Panel at Settings -> Sync. Wired the same five ways as the Timers entry
(`HubEntry::Kind`, the entry push, the dispatch branch, the include, `COMBOUI_SOURCES`).

**A poll, not a hook.** libultraship exposes no CVar change notification of any kind (there is an
`EventSystem`, but nothing in `ship/config` fires into it), and settings also move outside the combo
overlay's `ComboWidgetRender` funnel — popout editors, both games' Presets, the console. One per-frame
reconcile is one dispatch point; hooking every write site is not.

**Change-driven, never a reconcile.** Each pair records the last value it saw on each side and is
*armed* on its first tick without writing anything. Only a side that MOVED away from its recorded
value is propagated. **This is deliberate:** an at-boot "make them agree" pass would overwrite the
config of anyone who starts with the two games set differently. Turning a category off disarms its
pairs, so re-enabling it does not replay everything that changed meanwhile. MM wins a same-frame tie.

**Rows are only in the table when the value spaces match**, verified against each game's widget
declaration. Deliberately absent, with the reason at the site: `ClimbSpeed` (MM multiplies 1-5, OOT
adds 0-12), `DamageMultiplier` and `MirroredWorld` (enum lists overlap only in part), `CrouchStab`
(inverted polarity, 1:2), `SkipToFileSelect` (bool vs the `BootSequence` enum), `SkipGetItemCutscenes`
(4 values vs 3), `SkipEnemyCutscenes` (1 MM bool vs 2 OOT bools), `AlternateAssets` (per-game
archives, split on purpose). On the rando side every OOT `OPT_U8` against a plain MM bool is out —
pots, crates, grass, freestanding, wonder items, boss souls, tokens, shopsanity, item pool, ice traps —
as are the Triforce/win-condition keys (the launcher owns them and overwrites both games) and the
"add the OTHER game's content" options, which are mirrors rather than equals. Only two non-boolean
rows are in: `ShuffleBombArrows` and `ElementalWandShuffle`, whose three-value enums are identical in
both trees. `FastText` <-> `TextSpeed` carries an explicit bool <-> 1-6 translation, and the
first-person sensitivity rows clamp on the way into MM (OOT's slider reaches 5x, MM's stops at 2x).

**Not covered:** the five audio volume sliders keep their existing one-way `ComboAudioBridge`
(OOT -> MM, different value spaces); a second mechanism writing those keys would fight it. The input
viewer's renamed `LeftAnalogAngles` subtree is left out — niche, and its colour CVars need a different
accessor.

**On future merges:** the table is CVar strings, so a rename on either side silently stops syncing that
row rather than breaking anything. Re-check it when either menu is reworked.
